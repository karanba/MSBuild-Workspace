### Hello World! :earth_africa:

Root element for an msbuild file must be *Project* and xml namesspace is *http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003*   

MSBuild File: [hello-world.msbuild](https://github.com/karanba/MSBuild-Workspace/blob/01-Basics/src/hello-world.msbuild)
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
    <Target Name="hello-world">
        <Message Text="Hello, World!" />>
    </Target>
</Project>
```

:runner: _to run this file_; 

```powershell
msbuild .\src\hello-world.msbuild
```
:scroll: _output:_

```powershell

Project "C:\repo\GitHub\MSBuild-Workspace\src\hello-world.msbuild" on node 1 (default targets).
HelloWorld:
  Hello, World!
Done Building Project "C:\repo\GitHub\MSBuild-Workspace\src\hello-world.msbuild" (default targets).


Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)
```

### Where is MSBuild.exe :mag: 

Inside .net framework folder;
```powershell
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe
```
Also _msbuild.exe.config_,  _MSBuild.rsp_ file and _MSBuild_ folder is there which holds _xsd_ files that define the structure inside msbuild xml file.

``` bash
 MSBUild /
 ---- Microsoft.Build.Commontypes.xsd
 ---- Microsoft.Build.Core.xsd
```

Inside Visual Studio Installation folder;
```powershell
TODO: Add Path
```

### Targets

There can be multiple targets on an MSBuild file. If there is more than one task first one will be run. It can be changed by passing the parameter _/target: \<target name\>_ or like _/t: \<target name\>_

```powershell
msbuild .\src\targets.msbuild /target:OtherTask
```

Also we can use _DefaultTargets_ attribute for _Project_ element like below;

MSBuild File: [targets.msbuild](https://github.com/karanba/MSBuild-Workspace/blob/01-Basics/src/targets.msbuild)
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project DefaultTargets="OtherTask" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
    <Target Name="HelloWorld">
        <Message Text="Hello, World!" />
    </Target>
    <Target Name="OtherTask">
        <Message Text="Do smth else" />
    </Target>
</Project>
```
If you both have  _DefaultTargets_ atrribute inside file ans alos use _/target:\<Task Name\>_ together, command line parameter will ovewrite _DefaultTargets_ attribute.
